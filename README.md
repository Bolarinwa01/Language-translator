As a web developer, I have experience building user-friendly translation pages for a variety of languages. One example is a page that allows users to translate text from English to Spanish, French, and German. The page includes a text input field for the original text, a drop-down menu to select the target language, and a button to initiate the translation. The translated text is displayed in a designated area on the page. The page also includes functionality to detect the source language of the input text and display the correct flag of the language ensuring fast and accurate translations.
